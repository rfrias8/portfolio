        <h4 class="border">About Me</h4>
        <p>I am and entry level junior full stack developer with a high desire to learn who is currently a student of Generation USA's Junior Full Stack Developer program. I am making the switch to the tech field in pursuit of an opportunity where I can put my intensive training to to use and be challenged on an everyday basis. Web development caught my interest because I enjoy learning new things, taking on challenges, and working with others to solve problems.  Web development encompasses all of these things that I enjoy in many different ways, and will ensure that I never stop learning new things. I have worked on some group projects building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I am eager to keep learning and excited be able to apply what I learn to real-world situations.</p>
